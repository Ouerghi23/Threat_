## Executive Summary
The IP address 185.220.101.1 has been identified as a highly malicious Tor exit node with a CRITICAL risk score of 94/100. This IOC is associated with widespread malicious activity as reported by multiple threat intelligence sources, indicating a significant and immediate threat to the organization.

## Threat Analysis
The IOC, 185.220.101.1, is an IPv4 address identified as a Tor exit node. The use of Tor is a common tactic by malicious actors to anonymize their activities, making it difficult to trace their origin. This IP address has been extensively flagged across various threat intelligence platforms:
-   **VirusTotal**: 13 security vendors flagged this IP as malicious, and 2 as suspicious, along with a negative reputation score. This indicates a strong consensus within the security community regarding its hostile nature.
-   **AbuseIPDB**: It boasts a 100% confidence score based on 193 reports, confirming a high volume of reported abusive behavior originating from this IP.
-   **OTX AlienVault**: The presence of 50 threat intelligence pulses suggests its involvement in numerous campaigns or observed malicious activities.
The IP is registered to AS60729 Stiftung Erneuerbare Freiheit in Germany. While no open ports or vulnerabilities were detected by Shodan, the primary concern stems from its function as a Tor exit node combined with the overwhelming malicious reputation. The context "Auto-analyzed IOC" from "SOC Automation" signifies that this alert was generated due to automated detection of its malicious characteristics and its function as a Tor exit node in outbound connections, indicating potential unauthorized communication or data exfiltration attempts from within the network.

## Risk Factors
-   VirusTotal: 13 vendors flagged as malicious (+30 points)
-   VirusTotal: 2 vendors flagged as suspicious (+4 points)
-   VirusTotal: Negative reputation score -22 (+10 points)
-   AbuseIPDB: Confidence score 100% with 193 reports (+25.0 points)
-   OTX AlienVault: 50 threat intelligence pulses (+15 points)
-   Anonymization: Tor detected (+10 points)
The aggregation of these factors results in a CRITICAL risk score of 94/100.

## 🤖 AI Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1.  **Block Immediately**: Add 185.220.101.1 to all perimeter firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and web proxies to prevent any further inbound or outbound communication.
2.  **Isolate Affected Systems**: Identify and immediately isolate any internal hosts that have established connections with 185.220.101.1.
3.  **Endpoint Forensics**: Initiate a forensic investigation on any systems found to have communicated with this IOC to determine the extent of potential compromise.

### Investigation Steps
1.  **Log Analysis**: Review all network device logs (firewall, proxy, DNS, IDS/IPS) for historical and current connections to/from 185.220.101.1 to understand the scope and duration of interaction.
2.  **Traffic Analysis**: Analyze network traffic captures (if available) related to the identified connections to uncover the nature of the communication (e.g., C2, data exfiltration, malware download).
3.  **Threat Hunting**: Proactively hunt for other indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with this IP or similar Tor-related activities within the network.
4.  **User Activity Review**: Investigate user accounts and activities on compromised systems to identify any unusual behavior.

### Containment Measures
1.  **Network Segmentation**: Review and enforce strict network segmentation rules to limit the blast radius of any potential compromise.
2.  **Egress Filtering**: Enhance egress filtering policies to restrict outbound connections to known malicious IPs and anonymization services like Tor, unless explicitly required and justified.
3.  **Update Threat Feeds**: Ensure all security tools and platforms are updated with the latest threat intelligence, including this IOC.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
-   **TA0011 - Command and Control**: The use of a Tor exit node often facilitates anonymous command and control channels for adversaries (T1090.003 Proxy: Tor).
-   **T1090.003 - Proxy: Tor**: This technique is directly identified by the presence of a Tor exit node.
-   **TA0009 - Collection**: If the outbound connection was initiated by an internal compromised host, it could indicate data collection efforts before exfiltration.
-   **TA0010 - Exfiltration**: The connection to a Tor exit node from an internal host could be a precursor to or an active mechanism for exfiltrating sensitive data (T1041 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).

## Conclusion
The IOC 185.220.101.1 represents a CRITICAL and immediate threat due to its identification as a malicious Tor exit node with extensive negative reputation across multiple intelligence sources. Prompt and decisive action is required to mitigate potential compromise, prevent data loss, and maintain the security posture of the organization. The urgency level is **EXTREME**.
