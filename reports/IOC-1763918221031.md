## Executive Summary
This IP address (185.220.101.1) has been identified as a highly malicious Tor exit node with a critical risk score of 97/100. It is associated with extensive abuse reports, multiple malicious detections from VirusTotal, and active threat intelligence pulses, indicating its use in nefarious activities.

## Threat Analysis
The IOC 185.220.101.1 is an IPv4 address identified as a Tor exit node. Its context indicates it was auto-analyzed, and its source is SOC Automation, suggesting a detection within the network or through automated scanning. The risk assessment places it at a critical level with a score of 97/100, requiring immediate action.

Threat intelligence data reveals a high level of maliciousness:
- **VirusTotal**: 13 vendors flagged it as malicious and 2 as suspicious, contributing significantly to its negative reputation.
- **AbuseIPDB**: An alarming confidence score of 100% with 192 reports, strongly indicating a history of abusive activities from this IP.
- **OTX Pulses**: 50 threat intelligence pulses from AlienVault OTX further confirm its involvement in various malicious campaigns.
- **Anonymization**: The detection as a Tor exit node is a significant risk factor, as Tor is frequently used by threat actors to anonymize their activities, making attribution and tracking difficult.
- **Open Ports**: The presence of 3 open ports, although not specified which ones, could potentially expose services that could be exploited.
- **Geographic Location**: The IP is located in Germany, associated with "AS60729 Stiftung Erneuerbare Freiheit".

The cumulative evidence strongly suggests that this IP address is actively used for malicious purposes, potentially for command and control, data exfiltration, or as a jump point for other attacks.

*   **Open Ports**: 3 open ports detected by Shodan (+3 points).

## 🤖 AI Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
*   **Block IOC**: Immediately block the IP address 185.220.101.1 at all perimeter firewalls, network access control points, and proxies to prevent any further inbound or outbound communication.
*   **Isolate Affected Systems**: If any internal systems were observed communicating with this IOC, isolate them immediately and perform a full forensic analysis.
*   **Review SIEM Alerts**: Review all SIEM alerts and logs for any past or ongoing connections to this IOC.

### Investigation Steps
*   **Internal Scan**: Conduct an internal network scan to identify any other potentially compromised systems or lateral movement.
*   **Endpoint Analysis**: Perform deep analysis on any endpoints that communicated with the IOC for signs of compromise (malware, unusual processes, persistence mechanisms).
*   **Historical Data Review**: Analyze historical network flow data (NetFlow, IPFIX) for previous connections to this IOC and other Tor exit nodes.
*   **User Activity Review**: Investigate user activity associated with any connections to determine if it was intentional or accidental.

### Containment Measures
*   **Firewall Rule Enforcement**: Implement permanent firewall rules to deny all traffic to and from 185.220.101.1.
*   **IDS/IPS Signature Updates**: Ensure IDS/IPS systems have the latest signatures to detect and prevent communication with known malicious IPs and Tor exit nodes.
*   **Security Awareness Training**: Reinforce security awareness training for employees regarding the risks associated with Tor usage and anonymous browsing.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
*   **TA0011 - Command and Control**: The use of a Tor exit node suggests attempts to evade detection and maintain covert communication with compromised systems.
*   **T1090 - Proxy**: Specifically, T1090.003 (Multi-hop Proxy) through Tor is indicated.
*   **TA0009 - Collection**: Data exfiltration attempts could be masked by Tor traffic.
*   **TA0010 - Exfiltration**: Potentially used as an exfiltration point for stolen data.

## Conclusion
The IOC 185.220.101.1 presents a CRITICAL threat due to its identification as a highly malicious Tor exit node with an extremely high risk score of 97/100. The confluence of numerous malicious detections from reputable threat intelligence sources, coupled with its role in anonymization, necessitates immediate and decisive action. The urgency level is HIGH, and prompt blocking and thorough investigation are paramount to prevent potential data breaches or further compromise.
