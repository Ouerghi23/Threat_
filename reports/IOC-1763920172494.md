## 🤖 AI Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
- Block the IP address 195.54.160.149 at all perimeter firewalls, network access control points, and any relevant security devices to prevent further communication.
- Isolate any internal systems or endpoints that have been observed communicating with 195.54.160.149 to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.

### Investigation Steps
- Conduct a thorough search across all network logs (firewall, proxy, DNS, SIEM, EDR) for any historical or ongoing connections to/from 195.54.160.149.
- Identify the source and reason for this IOC being triggered in the first place (e.g., alert from an internal system, external threat intelligence feed match).
- Analyze traffic patterns and data flows associated with any detected communications to understand the nature and intent of the interaction.
- Cross-reference this IP with other internal threat intelligence and incident response data for any related or similar past incidents.

### Containment Measures
- Implement and enforce host-based firewall rules on critical assets to deny connections to 195.54.160.149.
- Update Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) signatures with this IOC to detect and block any attempted communications.
- Consider deploying additional network segmentation if widespread internal communication with the malicious IP is discovered.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- **TA0011 - Command and Control**: The detection of a malicious IP address with multiple threat intelligence flags strongly suggests its potential use as a Command and Control (C2) server for malware or adversary communications.
    - **T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**: Adversaries may communicate over common application layer protocols to avoid detection.
        - **T1071.001 - Web Protocols**: Communication over HTTP/HTTPS.
        - **T1071.004 - DNS**: Communication potentially disguised as DNS queries/responses.

## Conclusion
The IP address 195.54.160.149 is confirmed as malicious with a medium risk level. The presence of multiple threat intelligence flags from reputable sources like VirusTotal and OTX necessitates urgent attention. Immediate blocking of this IP and a comprehensive investigation are critical to prevent potential compromise and maintain the security posture of the organization.
