## Executive Summary
The IP address 195.54.160.149 has been identified as a highly malicious indicator of compromise (IOC) with a risk score of 55/100. This IP is flagged by multiple reputable threat intelligence sources, including VirusTotal (15 malicious detections) and OTX AlienVault (50 threat intelligence pulses), indicating its active involvement in malicious activities.

## Threat Analysis
The analyzed IOC is an IPv4 address, 195.54.160.149, originating from Italy and associated with the organization AS62005 BlueVPS OU.
- **VirusTotal**: 15 security vendors flagged this IP as malicious, contributing significantly to its high-risk score. It also has a negative reputation score of -65.
- **AbuseIPDB**: While only 1 report was recorded, its 0/100 score indicates potential limitations in AbuseIPDB's confidence for this specific report, but the presence of a report still suggests suspicious activity.
- **OTX AlienVault**: A significant 50 threat intelligence pulses are associated with this IP, strongly suggesting its widespread recognition as a threat by the security community.
- **Shodan**: No open ports were detected, which could imply the use of covert communication channels or that Shodan's scan did not align with the active malicious ports.
- **Additional Context**: No vulnerabilities, VPN, Proxy, or Tor usage were directly identified. The IOC was auto-analyzed, signifying a programmatic detection.

## Risk Factors
*   **VirusTotal: 15 vendors flagged as malicious (+30)** - A high number of detections from diverse security vendors indicates a widespread consensus on the malicious nature of this IP.
*   **VirusTotal: Negative reputation score -65 (+10)** - A highly negative reputation score on VirusTotal further confirms its malicious standing.
*   **OTX AlienVault: 50 threat intelligence pulses (+15)** - Numerous threat intelligence pulses from OTX AlienVault signify active monitoring and reporting of this IP as a threat by the security community.

## 🤖 AI Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
*   **Block IP Address**: Immediately block the IP address 195.54.160.149 at all perimeter security devices, including firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), web application firewalls (WAFs), and routers.
*   **Isolate Communicating Systems**: Identify and isolate any internal systems or endpoints that have recently communicated with 195.54.160.149 to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration.

### Investigation Steps
*   **Log Analysis**: Conduct a thorough review of network traffic logs, firewall logs, proxy logs, and DNS query logs for any connections to or from 195.54.160.149 within your environment.
*   **Endpoint Forensics**: Perform forensic analysis on any endpoints identified as having communicated with this malicious IP to determine the nature of the interaction, potential malware infection, and scope of compromise.
*   **Threat Hunting**: Proactively hunt for indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with threat actors or malware families linked to this IP, leveraging internal security tools and external threat intelligence.
*   **Contextual Analysis**: Investigate the specifics of the 15 malicious VirusTotal detections and the 50 OTX pulses to understand the exact nature of the threats (e.g., specific malware, campaign type).

### Containment Measures
*   **Network Segmentation**: Enforce strict network segmentation to limit the lateral movement capabilities of an attacker should an internal host be compromised through interaction with this IP.
*   **Egress Filtering**: Implement robust egress filtering rules to prevent internal systems from initiating connections to known malicious IP addresses like 195.54.160.149.
*   **Security Control Updates**: Ensure all security controls (IDS/IPS signatures, antivirus definitions, EDR rules) are up-to-date to detect and prevent communication with this and similar malicious IPs.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
*   **TA0011 - Command and Control**: Given the high malicious score and threat intelligence pulses, this IP likely serves as a Command and Control (C2) server for malware or adversary operations.
*   **T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**: Communication with this IP often occurs over standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) for C2 activities, even if direct open ports were not detected.
*   **TA0008 - Lateral Movement**: If an internal system is observed communicating with this IP, it could indicate a compromised host attempting to establish external C2 or participate in botnet activities.

## Conclusion
The IP address 195.54.160.149 is unequivocally a malicious indicator of compromise with a medium risk level, demanding immediate attention. The consensus from multiple threat intelligence sources confirms its active role in adverse activities. The urgency level is HIGH, and swift action is paramount to mitigate potential risks to organizational assets and maintain a strong security posture.
