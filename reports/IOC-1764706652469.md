## AI Analysis and Recommendations

### Verdict: CRITICAL
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Threat Actor:** Unknown (likely financially motivated cybercriminals or privacy-aware malicious actors leveraging Tor infrastructure)
**Attack Vector:** Network-based (potential for C2 communication, data exfiltration, anonymized scanning/attacks, or other malicious traffic originating from a Tor exit node)
**MITRE ATT&CK Tactics:**
- **TA0011 - Impact:** Potential for disruption of services, data integrity loss.
- **TA0009 - Collection:** Anonymized data collection or reconnaissance.
- **TA0010 - Exfiltration:** Anonymized data egress.

### Reasoning:
The IOC 185.220.101.1 exhibits an extremely high risk score of 96/100, driven by multiple factors. Its identification as a Tor exit node immediately raises its risk profile due to the common use of Tor for anonymization in malicious activities. The overwhelming number of malicious and suspicious detections on VirusTotal, coupled with a 100% confidence score and numerous reports on AbuseIPDB, confirm its active involvement in hostile operations. The significant number of OTX pulses further underscores its notoriety within the threat intelligence community. While no open ports were detected by Shodan, the primary threat stems from its function as an anonymizing proxy frequently abused by attackers.

### Recommended Actions:
1.  **Block Threat (Automated):** Implement an immediate and automated block of IP address 185.220.101.1 at all network perimeters (firewalls, proxies, EDR solutions) for a duration of 24 hours. This will prevent any inbound or outbound communication with this highly malicious entity.
2.  **Monitor Network Logs:** Continuously monitor network logs for any historical or ongoing connections to/from 185.220.101.1 within the environment. Investigate any findings thoroughly.
3.  **Threat Hunting:** Conduct proactive threat hunting across the network for any indicators related to Tor usage or other TTPs associated with anonymization services and the observed risk factors.
4.  **Security Awareness:** Educate users on the risks associated with Tor and other anonymization services, especially if not sanctioned for legitimate business purposes.
