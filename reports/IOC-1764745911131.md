    {\"action\": \"Implement strict egress filtering\", \"priority\": 2}\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"The IOC 45.155.205.233 is highly malicious, evidenced by 18 VirusTotal detections, a negative reputation score, and 26 OTX pulses. Its origin in a high-risk country (RU) further escalates the threat level. The high risk score of 70/100 necessitates immediate blocking and comprehensive investigation to prevent and mitigate potential breaches. This IP is likely involved in command and control activities or as part of a botnet, and its lack of open ports may indicate a more stealthy approach or reliance on other vectors.\"\n}\n\n\n=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===\nBased on the high risk score of 70/100 and comprehensive analysis:\n1. Block the IOC 45.155.205.233 at perimeter firewalls for a duration of 6 hours.\n2. Review network logs for any connections to or from this IP address.\n3. Conduct endpoint forensics on any systems that communicated with this IOC.\n4. Implement strict egress filtering to prevent data exfiltration.\n5. Continuously monitor threat intelligence feeds for updates on this IOC.\n
